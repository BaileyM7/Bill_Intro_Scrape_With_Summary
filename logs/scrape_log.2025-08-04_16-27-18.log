The legislation aims to prepare students to be informed and civically responsible adults by promoting an understanding of various political ideologies that challenge the principles of democracy.\n\nThe Act mandates that the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation create educational materials to educate students about the historical impact of communism, which has resulted in over 100 million deaths globally, and the ongoing struggles of approximately 1.5 billion individuals still living under oppressive regimes.
